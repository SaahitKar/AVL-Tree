# AVL-Tree

This program takes in a file with ISBN numbers and names of the books and authors and first creates an AVL tree with the ISBN numbers from the file. The program outputs any imbalances that occur during the creation of the tree and does the necessary rotations to maintain the balance of the AVL tree. Then, the program creates a binary tree with the ISBN numbers from the file and checks if the binary tree is a binary search tree, and if the binary tree is a binary search tree, then the program checks if the binary tree is an AVL tree.
